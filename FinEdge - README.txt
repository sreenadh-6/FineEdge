FinEdge - README
Project Overview
This repository contains the code for FinEdge's website, which aims to revolutionize cross-border payments. The website showcases the company's services and provides a contact form for users to reach out.

Design and Development Process
The design and development process for the FinEdge website involved the following steps:

Defining the Structure: The first step was to outline the structure of the website. This involved creating sections for Home, About Us, Services, and Contact Us.

Styling and Layout: Once the structure was defined, the next step was to apply CSS styles and layout to the different sections. The website uses a responsive design to ensure compatibility across different devices and screen sizes.

Adding Content: After the basic layout was established, content was added to each section. This included headings, paragraphs, and images relevant to the respective sections.

Navigation: A navigation bar was implemented at the top of the page to allow users to easily navigate between sections. Each navigation link is anchored to the corresponding section on the page.

Contact Form: The Contact Us section includes a form where users can enter their name, email, and message. A Vue.js component was used to handle form submission, and a simple console log statement was added to demonstrate the functionality.

Testing and Refinement: The website was tested on different browsers and devices to ensure a consistent and user-friendly experience. Any issues or inconsistencies were addressed and refined.

Challenges Encountered and Resolutions
During the development process, a few challenges were encountered. Here are the challenges and their resolutions:

Styling and Responsiveness: Designing a visually appealing and responsive layout that worked well on different screen sizes was a challenge. It required careful selection of colors, fonts, and spacing, as well as the use of media queries to adjust the layout for smaller screens. By utilizing CSS techniques and testing across various devices, the layout and responsiveness were refined.

Vue.js Implementation: Implementing Vue.js for the contact form and handling form submission posed a challenge for developers who were not familiar with the framework. However, by following the official documentation and examples, the Vue.js component was successfully integrated into the website, and the form submission functionality was achieved.

The repository has the following structure:

index.html: The main HTML file that renders the FinEdge website.
style.css: The CSS file containing the custom styles for the website.
README.md: The README document providing an overview of the project, development process, and challenges encountered.
